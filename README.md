# ServerBase
Management and communication procedures and function common to typical IoT projects.  Available as a library for easy re-use.

This is an initial attempt to combine [the server code](https://github.com/LaudixGit/ServerBase-Standalone) with the techniques of a [multi-threaded library](https://github.com/LaudixGit/BlinkerServer).
